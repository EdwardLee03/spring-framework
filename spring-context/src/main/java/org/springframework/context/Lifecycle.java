/**
 * A common interface defining methods for start/stop lifecycle control.
 * The typical use case for this is to control asynchronous processing.
 * <b>NOTE: This interface does not imply specific auto-startup semantics.
 * Consider implementing {@link SmartLifecycle} for that purpose.</b>
 * 组件生命周期管理接口，定义启动/停止生命周期控制的方法。
 * 典型的用例是控制异步处理。
 *
 * <p>Can be implemented by both components (typically a Spring bean defined in a
 * Spring context) and containers  (typically a Spring {@link ApplicationContext}
 * itself). Containers will propagate start/stop signals to all components that
 * apply within each container, e.g. for a stop/restart scenario at runtime.
 * 可以由bean组件和应用上下文容器同时实现。
 * 容器将开始/停止信号传播到每个容器中应用的所有组件。
 *
 * <p>Can be used for direct invocations or for management operations via JMX.
 * In the latter case, the {@link org.springframework.jmx.export.MBeanExporter}
 * will typically be defined with an
 * {@link org.springframework.jmx.export.assembler.InterfaceBasedMBeanInfoAssembler},
 * restricting the visibility of activity-controlled components to the Lifecycle
 * interface.
 *
 * <p>Note that the Lifecycle interface is only supported on <b>top-level singleton
 * beans</b>. On any other component, the Lifecycle interface will remain undetected
 * and hence ignored. Also, note that the extended {@link SmartLifecycle} interface
 * provides integration with the application context's startup and shutdown phases.
 * 注意：组件生命周期管理接口仅支持顶层的单例beans。
 * 注意：扩展的指南的组件生命周期管理接口提供与应用上下文的启动和关闭阶段的集成。
