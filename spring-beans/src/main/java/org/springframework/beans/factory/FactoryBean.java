/**
 * Interface to be implemented by objects used within a {@link BeanFactory} which
 * are themselves factories for individual objects. If a bean implements this
 * interface, it is used as a factory for an object to expose, not directly as a
 * bean instance that will be exposed itself.
 * {@link BeanFactory}中使用的对象实现的回调，它们本身就是各个对象的工厂。
 * 如果bean实现了这个接口，它将被用作暴露对象的工厂，而不是直接作为将自己暴露的bean实例。
 *
 * <p><b>NB: A bean that implements this interface cannot be used as a normal bean.</b>
 * A FactoryBean is defined in a bean style, but the object exposed for bean
 * references ({@link #getObject()}) is always the object that it creates.
 * 注意：实现此接口的bean不能用作普通bean。
 * FactoryBean以bean样式定义，但为bean引用暴露的对象({@link #getObject()})，始终是它创建的对象。
 *
 * <p>FactoryBeans can support singletons and prototypes, and can either create
 * objects lazily on demand or eagerly on startup. The {@link SmartFactoryBean}
 * interface allows for exposing more fine-grained behavioral metadata.
 * FactoryBeans可以支持单例和原型，可以根据需要延迟地创建对象，也可以在启动时急切地创建对象。
 * {@link SmartFactoryBean}接口允许暴露更细粒度的行为元数据。
 *
 * <p>This interface is heavily used within the framework itself, for example for
 * the AOP {@link org.springframework.aop.framework.ProxyFactoryBean} or the
 * {@link org.springframework.jndi.JndiObjectFactoryBean}. It can be used for
 * custom components as well; however, this is only common for infrastructure code.
 * 该接口在框架内部大量使用。
 * 它也可以用于定制组件; 但是，这仅适用于基础架构代码。
 *
 * <p><b>{@code FactoryBean} is a programmatic contract. Implementations are not
 * supposed to rely on annotation-driven injection or other reflective facilities.</b>
 * {@link #getObjectType()} {@link #getObject()} invocations may arrive early in
 * the bootstrap process, even ahead of any post-processor setup. If you need access
 * other beans, implement {@link BeanFactoryAware} and obtain them programmatically.
 * FactoryBean是一个编程式合约。
 * 实现不应该依赖注解驱动的注入或其他反射设施。
 * {@link #getObject()}调用可能在引导过程的早期到达，甚至在任何后置处理器设置之前。
 * 如果您需要访问其他beans，请实现{@link BeanFactoryAware}并以编程方式获取它们。
 *
 * <p>Finally, FactoryBean objects participate in the containing BeanFactory's
 * synchronization of bean creation. There is usually no need for internal
 * synchronization other than for purposes of lazy initialization within the
 * FactoryBean itself (or the like).
 * 最后，FactoryBean对象参与包含BeanFactory的bean创建同步。
 * 除了FactoryBean本身中的延迟初始化之外，通常不需要内部同步。
